            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Stem cells are the body's raw materials â€” cells from which all other cells with specialized functions are
              generated. Under the right conditions in the body or a laboratory, stem cells divide to form more cells
              called daughter cells.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              These daughter cells either become new stem cells (self-renewal) or become specialized cells
              (differentiation) with a more specific function, such as blood cells, brain cells, heart muscle cells or
              bone cells.

                  These are the blood-forming stem cells found in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and cord blood. They
                  can develop into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and
                  platelets.

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Hematopoietic stem cell transplants are used to treat blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, as

                  Found in bone marrow, fat tissue, and other sources, these stem cells can develop into bone,

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  This is the most common method of donation, used in about 80% of cases. The process involves:
                </p>
                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Receiving injections of a medication that increases stem cell production for 4-5 days</li>
                  <li>Having blood removed through a needle in one arm</li>
                  <li>Passing the blood through a machine that separates out the stem cells</li>
                  <li>Returning the remaining blood through a needle in the other arm</li>
                </ol>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                  The procedure takes about 4-6 hours and is similar to donating platelets.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Used in about 20% of cases, this method involves:</p>
                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                  <li>Receiving general anesthesia</li>
                  <li>Having liquid marrow extracted from the back of the pelvic bone using a special needle</li>
                  <li>A hospital stay of 1-2 days</li>
                  <li>Recovery period of about 1-2 weeks</li>
                </ol>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                  While this method is less common, it's sometimes the best option for certain patients, especially

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                For peripheral blood stem cell donation, donors may experience flu-like symptoms during the days they
                receive injections. The donation process itself is not painful, though some people experience discomfort
                from having to remain still for several hours.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                For bone marrow donation, donors receive anesthesia, so the procedure itself is painless. After
                donation, donors may experience soreness in the lower back for a few days to a week.
